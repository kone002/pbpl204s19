# Getting Started with Git and GitHub

We will be using git and github for the course, both to build the course documents as well as to collaborate on the course exercises. Thus, learning these tools is vital to your success in this course, and these skill sets are going to be increasingly important in regional analysis and policy circles over time.



## Installation

Two steps are required: setting up a github account and installing a GitHub client for your computer.


### Github Account 

If you do not already have one, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account). You should sign up for a *personal* account, not an *organization* account.


### GitHub Desktop

Follow the instructions at [Getting Started with Github Desktop](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
 to install a client for your own computer.
